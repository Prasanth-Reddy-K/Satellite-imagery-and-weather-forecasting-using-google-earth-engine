# Satellite-imagery-and-weather-forecasting-using-google-earth-engine

The topic that we have chosen for the mini project is SATELLITE IMAGERY AND WEATHER FORECASTING USING GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE. The aim of the SATELLITE IMAGERY AND WEATHER FORECASTING is to work with Satellite Imagery and visualize them using Python. The main objective of the work that we have chosen is to ensure effective and reliable approaches for recognition of the images of the countries using python and Google Earth Engine and also to predict the different types of weather conditions such as Heat, Surface air Temperatures of different countries. Our application purpose is of learning and applying Google Earth Engine in python. Google Earth Engine is one of the best sources for satellite imagery and computation. It is a platform for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets, for academic, non-profit, business, and government users. Earth Engine hosts satellite imagery and stores it in a public data archive that includes historical earth images going back more than forty years. As, Satellites circle the Earth, so their imaging activity can be represented easily. The circumstances that made us to bring this proposition is to enhance the technologies that are currently emerging in the digital world. The design is so simple that the user wonâ€™t find any difficulties in using this system. One can check the different countries satellite images and different weather conditions
